LightByrinthe
=============

Project of the Rota Team during the GG14 (@Epitech Paris)

The game is about controlling light. You control lights to help little mechas escape a labyrinth. Mechas lose energy when not lighted. You control lights using the knobs of our midi device (key 9 to 12) or your XBOX360 control (choose the light with button X/Y/A/B and move it with the L/R triggers).
